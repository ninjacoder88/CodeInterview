A Preparation For Software Development Interviews

# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a place to review some of the basics of software development.

## Sorting Algorithms
**Bubble Sort**
Time Complexity: O(n) to O(n<sup>2</sup>)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Space Complexity: O()

**Insertion Sort**
Time Complexity: O(n) to O(n*2)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Space Complexity: O()

**Merge Sort**
Time Complexity: O(n log(n))
Auxiliary Space: O(n)
Space Complexity: O()

**Quick Sort**
