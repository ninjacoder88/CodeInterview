# CodeInterview
A Preparation For Software Development Interviews

# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a place to review some of the basics of software development.

## Sorting Algorithms
**Bubble Sort**
Time Complexity: O(n) to O(n<sup>2</sup>)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Space Complexity: O()

**Insertion Sort**
Time Complexity: O(n) to O(n*2)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Space Complexity: O()

**Merge Sort**
Time Complexity: O(n log(n))
Auxiliary Space: O(n)
Space Complexity: O()

**Quick Sort**
Time Complexity: O(n log(n)) to O(n<sup>2</sup>)
Auxiliary Space: O()
Space Complexity: O()

**Selection Sort**
Time Complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Space Complexity: O()

**Shell Sort**
Time Complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
Auxiliary Space: O()
Space Complexity: O()

**Visior**

## Data Structures
**Binary Tree**

**Doubly Linked List**

**Graph**

**Hash Table**

**Linked List**

**Queue**

**Stack**

**Tree**

**Trie**

## Problems
**Design a Parking Lot**
Given some contraints, (size of space), design a parking lot

**Find the Squares**
Given a set of points on a plane, determine how many squares exist (include askew squares)

**Find the Pair**
Given a set of numbers, find a pair where the sum equals a provided value

**Find All The Words On A Boogle Board**
Given a Boggle board 4x4 of some set of letters find all of the words

**Find Overlapping Squares**
Given a set of points representing squares on a plane, find the overlaping squares as well as the area of the overlap

**Draw a circle**

**Longest Palindromic Subsequnce**

**Remove Nodes from a Binary Tree**
Given a binary tree and a node to be deleted, remove the node from the tree. If the tree is fractured due to the removal return both trees

## Tips
- Practice writing code on a whiteboard
